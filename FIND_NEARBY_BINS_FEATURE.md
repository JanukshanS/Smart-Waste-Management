# Find Nearby Bins Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Find Nearby Bins feature allows citizens to discover waste collection bins near their current location using an interactive map interface. The feature includes real-time location tracking, customizable search radius, and detailed bin information display.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **API Integration**
- **File**: `src/api/citizenApi.js`
- **New Function**: `getNearbyBins(params)`
  - Fetches bins based on user's latitude, longitude, and search radius
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/citizen/bins/nearby?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius}`
  - Default radius: 5000m (5km)
  - Returns array of bins with location, fill level, status, and other details

### 2. **Bin Details Bottom Sheet**
- **File**: `src/components/Citizen/BinDetailsBottomSheet.js`
- **Features**:
  - Animated slide-up modal with backdrop
  - Bin information display:
    - Bin ID and type (household, recyclable, organic, general, hazardous)
    - Fill level with visual progress bar
    - Status badge (Available, Filling, Full)
    - Location details with embedded map
    - Collection count and last update time
    - Urgent collection warnings
  - Smooth animations using React Native Animated API
  - Scrollable content for long information

### 3. **Find Nearby Bins Screen**
- **File**: `src/screens/Citizen/FindBinsScreen.js`
- **Features**:
  - **Location Services**:
    - Requests foreground location permission
    - Gets user's current location with balanced accuracy
    - Shows loading state while fetching location
    - Error handling for denied permissions
  
  - **Interactive Map**:
    - Full-screen MapView using react-native-maps
    - Shows user's current location (blue dot)
    - Displays search radius as a transparent circle
    - Custom markers for each bin showing fill percentage
    - Color-coded markers:
      - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Available (0-49% full)
      - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Filling (50-79% full)
      - ðŸ”´ Red: Full (80-100% full)
    - Tap on markers to view bin details
  
  - **Information Panel** (Bottom overlay):
    - **Statistics**:
      - Total bins found
      - Available bins count
      - Bins needing collection
    - **Search Radius Controls**:
      - Quick select: 2km, 5km, 10km
      - Visual active state
      - Automatic bin refresh on radius change
    - **Status Legend**:
      - Color-coded status indicators
      - Clear labeling
    - **Refresh Button**:
      - Updates current location
      - Refetches nearby bins
      - Loading indicator during refresh

### 4. **Permissions Configuration**
- **File**: `app.json`
- **Added**:
  - iOS: Location usage descriptions
  - Android: ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permissions

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
1. User opens "Find Bins" screen
   â†“
2. App requests location permission
   â†“
3. Permission granted â†’ Get current location
   â†“
4. Fetch nearby bins from API (lat, lng, radius)
   â†“
5. Display bins on map with markers
   â†“
6. User taps on marker â†’ Show bottom sheet with bin details
   â†“
7. User can:
   - Change search radius
   - Refresh location
   - View different bins
   - Close bottom sheet
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the Citizen Dashboard
2. Tap on "Find Bins" quick action
3. Grant location permission when prompted
4. View nearby bins on the map

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used:
- `expo-location`: Get user's current location
- `react-native-maps`: Map visualization
- `react-native`: Core components (Modal, Animated, etc.)
- `expo-router`: Navigation

### Key Components:
- **MapView**: Main map display
- **Marker**: Bin location markers
- **Circle**: Search radius visualization
- **Modal**: Bottom sheet container
- **Animated**: Smooth animations

### State Management:

## Styling Guidelines

All styling follows the project's design system:
- Colors from `COLORS` constant
- Spacing from `SPACING` constant
- Consistent border radius: 12px
- Shadow/elevation for depth
- Green primary theme for citizen portal

## Error Handling

1. **Location Permission Denied**:
   - Shows error screen with retry button
   - Clear message about enabling location services

2. **Location Fetch Failed**:
   - Alert dialog with error message
   - Retry option available

3. **API Request Failed**:
   - Alert dialog with error message
   - Previous bin data remains visible

4. **No Location Available**:
   - Error screen with instructions
   - Retry button to request permission again

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Get directions to selected bin (integrate with maps app)
- [ ] Filter bins by type (household, recyclable, etc.)
- [ ] Show distance from user to each bin
- [ ] Save favorite bins
- [ ] Bin availability notifications
- [ ] Route planning to multiple bins
- [ ] Offline mode with cached bin locations
- [ ] AR view for bin location (camera overlay)

## Testing Notes

### Platform-Specific Considerations:

**Android**:
- Location permission dialog appears automatically
- GPS should be enabled on device
- Works in Expo Go app

**iOS**:
- Location permission dialog appears automatically
- Works in Expo Go app
- Requires location services enabled in Settings

**Web**:
- Browser location permission required
- Less accurate than native apps
- May not work in all browsers

## Known Limitations

1. **Accuracy**: Location accuracy depends on device GPS quality
2. **Web Platform**: Limited location features on web browsers
3. **Permissions**: Feature requires location permission to work
4. **Network**: Requires internet connection to fetch bin data

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: Bins not showing on map
- **Solution**: Check internet connection, verify API endpoint is accessible

**Issue**: Location permission denied
- **Solution**: Enable location in device settings, restart app

**Issue**: Markers not displaying correctly
- **Solution**: Ensure bin data includes valid coordinates

**Issue**: Map not loading
- **Solution**: Check react-native-maps installation, rebuild app if needed

## Conclusion

The Find Nearby Bins feature provides citizens with an intuitive way to locate waste collection bins in their vicinity. The implementation follows best practices for React Native development, adheres to the project's design system, and provides a smooth user experience with proper error handling and loading states.
