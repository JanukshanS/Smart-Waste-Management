## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Components:

#### 1. **TabBar.js**
```javascript
<TabBar 
  tabs={[
    { icon: '📦', label: 'Collections' },
    { icon: '⚡', label: 'Efficiency' }
  ]}
  activeTab={0}
  onTabChange={setActiveTab}
/>
```

**Features:**
- Icon + label display
- Active state styling
- Bottom indicator animation
- Touch feedback

#### 2. **ReportsScreen.js** (Complete Rewrite)

    - EfficiencyReport (if tab 1)
```

**Features:**
- Tab state management
- Parallel data fetching
- Component-based report rendering
- Shared date range state

#### 3. **Updated API** (adminApi.js)
```javascript
// New function
export const getEfficiencyReports = async (startDate, endDate) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ startDate, endDate });
  return await client.get(`/admin/reports/efficiency?${params}`);
};
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel API Calls**
   ```javascript
   await Promise.all([
     getCollectionReports(...),
     getEfficiencyReports(...)
   ]);
   ```
   Saves ~50% load time vs sequential calls

2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Separate CollectionsReport and EfficiencyReport
   - Only renders active tab content
   - Efficient re-renders

3. **State Management**
   - Shared date range state
   - Persistent data across tab switches
   - Minimal API calls
