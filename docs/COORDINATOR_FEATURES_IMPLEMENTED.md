## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

**Pending Requests List:**
```
User → Opens Activity
  ↓
Load Requests → GET /api/coordinator/requests/pending
  ↓
Parse Response → List<WasteRequest>
  ↓
Adapter → Display in RecyclerView
```

**Approve Request:**
```
User → Taps "Approve"
  ↓
Confirmation Dialog → Shows request summary
  ↓
User Confirms → PUT /api/coordinator/requests/{id}/approve
  ↓
Success → Reload list + Show toast
```

**Reject Request:**
```
User → Taps "Reject"
  ↓
Reason Dialog → Text input + Suggestion chips
  ↓
User Enters Reason → PUT /api/coordinator/requests/{id}/reject
  ↓
Success → Reload list + Show toast
```

### API Integration

**CoordinatorApi Interface:**
```java
@GET("api/coordinator/requests/pending")
Call<ApiResponse<List<WasteRequest>>> getPendingRequests(
    @Query("page") Integer page,
    @Query("limit") Integer limit
);

@PUT("api/coordinator/requests/{id}/approve")
Call<ApiResponse<WasteRequest>> approveRequest(@Path("id") String requestId);

@PUT("api/coordinator/requests/{id}/reject")
Call<ApiResponse<WasteRequest>> rejectRequest(
    @Path("id") String requestId,
    @Body RejectReason reason
);
```

### WasteRequest Model Enhancement

Added helper methods to extract user data from populated userId:

```java
/**
 * Get user name from populated userId object
 */
public String getUserName() {
    if (userId instanceof LinkedTreeMap) {
        LinkedTreeMap userMap = (LinkedTreeMap) userId;
        return (String) userMap.get("name");
    }
    return null;
}

/**
 * Get user phone from populated userId object
 */
public String getUserPhone() {
    if (userId instanceof LinkedTreeMap) {
        LinkedTreeMap userMap = (LinkedTreeMap) userId;
        return (String) userMap.get("phone");
    }
    return null;
}
```

This handles cases where the API populates the user object instead of just returning the user ID.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. WasteRequest User Data Access
**Problem:** Request cards couldn't access user name and phone

**Solution:**
- Added `getUserName()` and `getUserPhone()` methods to WasteRequest
- Methods handle both String ID and populated User object cases
- Used LinkedTreeMap to extract data from populated objects

### 2. Missing Layout Button Reference
**Problem:** CoordinatorDashboardActivity referenced non-existent `monitorBinsButton`

**Solution:**
- Removed the button reference
- Bin monitoring already accessible via bottom navigation
- Cleaned up click listeners
