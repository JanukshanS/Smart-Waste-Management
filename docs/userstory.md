# Smart Waste Management - Complete Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap covers the complete implementation of all features for the Smart Waste Management Android application based on the MVP requirements and supporting all four user roles: **Citizen, Coordinator, Technician, and Admin**.

## Implementation Approach

- Follow user story flow (from user's perspective)
- Implement vertically (complete one feature end-to-end before moving to next)
- Each user story includes acceptance criteria and testing checklist
- API integration happens as part of each feature
