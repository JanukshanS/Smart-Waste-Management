# Vehicle Management System Implementation

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

---

## üéØ Overview

A complete vehicle management system has been implemented for the Smart Waste Management platform. This system allows coordinators to register, manage, and assign vehicles to collection routes, solving the previous issue where vehicle IDs had to be manually typed.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Backend (5 files)

#### 1. **Vehicle Model** (`csse-backend/src/models/Vehicle.model.js`)
- Complete vehicle data schema with:
  - Vehicle ID and license plate (unique, uppercase)
  - Vehicle type: truck, van, compactor, pickup
  - Capacity, manufacturer, model, year
  - Status: available, in-use, maintenance, decommissioned
  - Fuel type: diesel, petrol, electric, hybrid
  - Maintenance tracking (history, dates)
  - Assignment tracking (crew, route)
- Virtual fields for maintenance status
- Methods: `assignToCrew()`, `release()`, `addMaintenanceRecord()`

#### 2. **Vehicle Controller** (`csse-backend/src/controllers/vehicle.controller.js`)
- **8 API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/coordinator/vehicles` - List all vehicles with filtering
  - `GET /api/coordinator/vehicles/available` - Get available vehicles for assignment
  - `GET /api/coordinator/vehicles/:id` - Get vehicle details
  - `POST /api/coordinator/vehicles` - Create new vehicle
  - `PUT /api/coordinator/vehicles/:id` - Update vehicle
  - `DELETE /api/coordinator/vehicles/:id` - Delete vehicle
  - `PUT /api/coordinator/vehicles/:id/status` - Update vehicle status
  - `POST /api/coordinator/vehicles/:id/maintenance` - Add maintenance record

#### 3. **Vehicle Routes** (`csse-backend/src/routes/coordinator.routes.js`)
- All vehicle endpoints added with full Swagger documentation
- Query builder middleware for filtering and pagination
- Proper error handling and validation

### Frontend (7 files)

#### 4. **VehicleCard Component** (`src/components/Coordinator/VehicleCard.js`)
- Beautiful card UI for vehicle display
- Shows:
  - Vehicle ID and license plate
  - Type icon and capacity
  - Status badge (color-coded)
  - Manufacturer and model
  - Current assignment (crew/route)
  - Maintenance warnings
- Touch interaction for details view

#### 5. **VehiclesScreen** (`src/screens/Coordinator/VehiclesScreen.js`)
- **Full vehicle management interface:**
  - Statistics cards (Total, Available, In Use, Maintenance)
  - Search bar (by ID, plate, manufacturer, model)
  - Status filter chips (All, Available, In Use, Maintenance)
  - Vehicle list with pull-to-refresh
  - Floating "Add Vehicle" button
- **Create Vehicle Dialog:**
  - All vehicle fields with validation
  - Picker for vehicle type and fuel type
  - Auto-uppercase for ID and license plate
  - Handles creation errors gracefully

#### 6. **Updated RouteDetailsScreen** (`src/screens/Coordinator/RouteDetailsScreen.js`)
- **NEW: Vehicle Picker**  
  Replaced the manual text input with:
  - Horizontal scrollable vehicle selector
  - Shows available vehicles with details
  - Visual selection with highlighting
  - Displays: Vehicle ID, license plate, type, capacity, status
  - Disables in-use vehicles (but shows them)
  - Selected vehicle confirmation display
  - "Manage Vehicles" button if no vehicles exist

#### 7. **Vehicle API Functions** (`src/api/coordinatorApi.js`)
- 8 new API functions matching backend endpoints
- Proper error handling and logging
- TypeScript-style JSDoc comments

#### 8. **Navigation Route** (`app/coordinator/vehicles.js`)
- Expo Router route for `/coordinator/vehicles`

#### 9. **Dashboard Integration** (`src/screens/Coordinator/CoordinatorDashboardScreen.js`)
- Added "Manage Vehicles" action card
- Icon: üöõ
- Color: #FF5722 (orange-red)
- Also added "Manage Crews" card for consistency

#### 10. **Component Exports**
- Added to `src/components/Coordinator/index.js`
- Added to `src/screens/Coordinator/index.js`

## üîÑ New Workflow

### Before (‚ùå Manual Entry):
1. Coordinator opens route assignment dialog
2. Manually types vehicle ID (e.g., "TRUCK-01")
3. No validation, no vehicle list, prone to errors

### After (‚úÖ Smart Selection):
1. Coordinator opens route assignment dialog
2. Sees all available vehicles with details:
   - Vehicle ID and license plate
   - Type and capacity
   - Current status
   - Visual cards
3. Clicks to select a vehicle
4. System validates and assigns
5. If no vehicles exist, prompted to create them

## üìä Database Schema

```javascript
Vehicle {
  vehicleId: String (unique, uppercase)
  licensePlate: String (unique, uppercase)
  vehicleType: Enum [truck, van, compactor, pickup]
  capacity: Number // cubic meters
  status: Enum [available, in-use, maintenance, decommissioned]
  assignedCrewId: ObjectId -> User
  currentRouteId: ObjectId -> Route
  manufacturer: String
  model: String
  year: Number
  mileage: Number
  fuelType: Enum [diesel, petrol, electric, hybrid]
  lastMaintenanceDate: Date
  nextMaintenanceDate: Date
  maintenanceHistory: Array
  insuranceExpiryDate: Date
  registrationExpiryDate: Date
  notes: String
}
```
