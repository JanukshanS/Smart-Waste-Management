## Technical Details

### Component Structure
All new screens follow the project's established patterns:
- React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
- Expo Router for navigation
- React Native Paper components for UI
- Constants from theme.js for colors and spacing
- StyleSheet.create() for styling
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Auto-refresh for real-time data (where appropriate)

### Navigation Routes
All new screens have corresponding route files in `app/coordinator/`:
- `bin-details.js`
- `all-requests.js`
- `request-details.js`
- `analytics.js`
- `collection-history.js`
- `schedule.js`

### Export Structure
All screens exported from `src/screens/Coordinator/index.js` for easy imports.

## Code Quality

### Adherence to Project Guidelines ✅
