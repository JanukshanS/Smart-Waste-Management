# Authentication User Stories - Smart Waste Management System

## Epic 0.1: User Authentication & Authorization

### User Story 0.1.1: Role-Based Login with Device Storage ✅

**As a** User (Citizen/Coordinator/Technician/Admin)  
**I want to** log in with my email and password  
**So that** I can access my role-specific dashboard and my session persists on the device

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/login`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] User enters email and password
- [x] Credentials are validated (email format, required fields)
- [x] API call authenticates user
- [x] On successful login, user data is stored on device (AsyncStorage)
- [x] User role is stored on device
- [x] Authentication token is stored securely
- [x] User is automatically navigated to role-specific dashboard
- [ ] Session persists across app restarts (partially implemented)
- [ ] Automatic role-based navigation after login
- [x] Error messages shown for invalid credentials
- [x] Loading state displayed during authentication
- [x] Logout clears all stored data

**Role-Based Navigation:**
- **Citizen** → `/citizen` (Citizen Dashboard)
- **Coordinator** → `/coordinator` (Coordinator Dashboard)
- **Technician** → `/technician` (Technician Dashboard)
- **Admin** → `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)

**Device Storage (AsyncStorage):**
- `authToken` - JWT authentication token
- `user` - Complete user object including:
  - `_id` - User ID
  - `name` - Full name
  - `email` - Email address
  - `role` - User role (citizen/coordinator/technician/admin)
  - `phone` - Phone number
  - `address` - User address object
  - `createdAt` - Account creation date

**Implementation Checklist:**

- [x] Create AuthContext with AsyncStorage
- [x] Implement login API integration
- [x] Store user data on successful login
- [x] Store authentication token
- [x] Implement session persistence check on app start
- [x] Add automatic role-based navigation after login
- [x] Create navigation helper for role routing
- [x] Implement logout with data clearing
- [x] Add loading states
- [x] Add error handling with user feedback
- [x] Handle backend API response inconsistency (data in message field)
- [x] Test session persistence across app restarts
- [x] Test role-based navigation for all roles

**Security Considerations:**
- ✅ Passwords never stored on device
- ✅ Token stored in AsyncStorage (consider SecureStore for production)
- ✅ Session cleared on logout
- ⚠️ Consider token expiration and refresh mechanism (future)
- ⚠️ Consider biometric authentication (future)

### User Story 0.1.2: Sign Up with Role Assignment

**As a** New User  
**I want to** create an account with my details  
**So that** I can access the waste management system

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/signup`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] User enters name, email, password, phone, and address
- [x] Email format validation
- [x] Password strength validation
- [x] Phone number validation
- [x] Role defaults to 'citizen' for public signup
- [x] Duplicate email check shows error
- [x] On success, user is logged in automatically
- [x] User data stored on device
- [x] Navigate to citizen dashboard
- [x] Success message displayed

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Implemented

### User Story 0.1.3: Automatic Session Restoration

**As a** User  
**I want to** stay logged in after closing the app  
**So that** I don't have to log in every time

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] On app start, check for stored user data
- [x] If valid session exists, restore user state
- [x] Navigate to role-specific dashboard automatically
- [ ] If token expired, redirect to login
- [x] Show loading screen during check
- [x] Handle corrupted storage data gracefully

**Implementation Status:** ⚠️ Partially Implemented (role-based navigation needed)
