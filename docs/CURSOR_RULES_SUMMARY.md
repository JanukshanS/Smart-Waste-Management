## API Endpoints Overview

The backend provides four role-based API groups:

### Authentication (`/api/auth/*`)
- Signup and login
- Token-based authentication

### Citizen APIs (`/api/citizen/*`)
- Create waste pickup requests
- Track requests with timeline
- Find nearby smart bins
- Cancel requests
- Record payments

### Coordinator APIs (`/api/coordinator/*`)
- Dashboard with statistics
- Bin monitoring and filtering
- Request approval/rejection
- Route optimization
- Route management and assignment

### Technician APIs (`/api/technician/*`)
- Work order management
- Device registration and maintenance
- Work order resolution and escalation

### Admin APIs (`/api/admin/*`)
- User management
- System reports (collections, efficiency, devices)
- System health monitoring
- Data export
