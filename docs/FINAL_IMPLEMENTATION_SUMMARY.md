## 🔧 Special API Handling

### Inconsistent API Response Format
The backend returns data in an inconsistent format:
- `message` field contains the actual data object
- `data` field contains success message string

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created custom `LoginResponse` model
- Implemented `LoginResponse.Deserializer` 
- Used for both login and signup endpoints
- Profile update handles this with special logic

## 📊 App Statistics
- **Lines of Code**: 5000+
- **Activities**: 11
- **API Endpoints**: 25+
- **Models**: 12+
- **Layouts**: 30+
- **Roles Supported**: 4 (Citizen, Coordinator, Technician, Admin)

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Create Test Accounts
Sign up or have backend create users with different roles:
- Citizen account
- Coordinator account
- Technician account
- Admin account

### 2. Test Each Role
**Citizen**: 
- Create waste requests
- View request list and details
- Find nearby bins on map
- Edit profile

**Coordinator**:
- View dashboard statistics
- Approve/reject pending requests
- See bin fill levels
- Access profile

**Technician**:

- Access profile

**Admin**:
- View system overview
- See user statistics
