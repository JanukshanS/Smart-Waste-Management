## 🚀 What's Next (Not Yet Implemented)

### Create Bin with Map
The "Add Bin" FAB currently shows a placeholder. To complete:
1. Create `CreateBinActivity` or dialog with OSMDroid map
2. Tap map to select coordinates
3. Reverse geocoding for address
4. Form fields: Bin ID, Type, Capacity, Area
5. Call `POST /api/bins` API
6. Navigate back and refresh list

### Edit Bin
The "Edit Bin" menu action currently shows a placeholder. To complete:
1. Create `EditBinActivity` with pre-filled data
2. Map interface for updating coordinates
3. Update all editable fields except Bin ID (immutable)
4. Call `PUT /api/bins/{id}` API

### Map View Toggle
Add a toggle button to switch between:
- List view (current implementation)
- Map view showing all bins as markers (color-coded by fill level)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components
```
BinManagementActivity
├── AdminBinAdapter
│   └── item_admin_bin.xml
├── BinsApi (Retrofit)
│   ├── GET /api/bins
│   ├── PUT /api/bins/{id}/fill-level
│   ├── PUT /api/bins/{id}/empty
│   ├── PUT /api/bins/{id}/maintenance
│   └── DELETE /api/bins/{id}
└── Dialogs
    ├── Bin Details
    ├── Update Fill Level
    ├── Empty Confirmation
    ├── Maintenance Confirmation
    └── Delete Confirmation
```

### Data Flow
1. User opens Bin Management from Admin Dashboard
2. Activity loads bins via `BinsApi.getAllBins()`
3. Adapter displays bins with color-coded indicators
4. User filters/searches → Adapter filters in memory
5. User changes filters → New API call with parameters
6. User performs action → API call → Success → Refresh list

## 📝 Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Material Design 3 components
- ✅ Error handling with try-catch
- ✅ Null safety checks
- ✅ Resource references (no hardcoded strings/colors)
- ✅ Separation of concerns (Activity, Adapter, API)
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty states
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Toast feedback for all operations
- ✅ Role-based access control

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ RecyclerView for efficient list rendering
- ✅ In-memory search filtering (no API calls)
- ✅ ViewBinding for efficient view access
- ✅ Proper lifecycle management (`onDestroy` cleanup)
- ✅ SwipeRefreshLayout for manual refresh
